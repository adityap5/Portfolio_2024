I completed my schooling at Bhartiya Vidyapeeth School in Agra and currently I am  in my final year of engineering, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering at UIET Chandigarh. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a robust foundation in web development and software engineering.

I gained practical experience during my summer internship at GrapplTech, where I worked as a Software developer.My primary responsibilities included creating reusable components and templates with React.js and Tailwind CSS. This experience honed my skills in developing scalable and maintainable code, enhancing the overall efficiency of web applications.

Additionally, I interned at The Sparks Foundation as a web developer, where I worked on several tasks, including developing a basic banking system. This system enabled users to perform transactions and view their transaction history, providing me with valuable experience in backend integration and user interface design.

My projects have involved web application development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  To enhance my skills, I transitioned to React.js,I learned core concepts, hooks, routing, Context API, and Redux, incorporating Tailwind CSS for styling. I also expanded my skills to backend development with Node.js and Express.js, enabling me to build full-stack applications.

Furthermore, I have a foundational knowledge of Python and SQL. I understand the concepts of data pipelines and their types, although my practical experience with AWS data pipeline is limited to theoretical knowledge.

In my free time, I enjoy staying updated with the latest trends in web development. I am known for my hardworking nature and problem-solving skills, and I am eager to apply my technical knowledge and enthusiasm to contribute effectively to your team.
